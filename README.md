Estimating functional principal components as part of a spatio-temporal random effect model. 

This repository provides R code and data sets for implementing the method in the manuscript, "State space functional principal component analysis to identify spatiotemporal patterns in remote sensing lake water quality", which can be accessed via https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00477-021-02017-w, with application to remote-sensing lake water quality data.
